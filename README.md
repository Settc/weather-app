# Weather App


## Introduction
  This is a weather app designed by me, Thomas Whittle. Using the Open Weather API,
I implemented today's forecast in the main section, along with a five day forecast
including the date, temp, humidity, and an icon showing depicting the weather of that day.

  While I'm pretty happy with almost everything, the sidebar search has been giving me problems,
and I was not able to get it to fully work before my deadline. I believe this to be a case of
not realizing that the problems were due to the fundamental structure of my code, and then
over-complicating it with attempted solutions rather than starting over with a more sound
base.
